# Theberton Lion

I was provided with a set of static pages and assets that had been downloaded from Wordpress.  

My intention was to redevelop the site using Javascript, adding new features whilst retaining the brand identity of the pub.  

I had recently followed a React course and thoroughly enjoyed learning it, so decided to put what I had learnt into practice.   


## Backend

The present version of the site is hosted on Netlify, using Netlify CMS as the backend. It was important that the client had an interface whereby he could update the contents of the website independently, given the changing nature of the services his business offers. I have been very pleased with the fact that I can make structural updates to the site and have it update through Github, whilst my client can make updates to the content, which I can then pull to avoid any conflicts. One of the biggest challenges I faced was in learning how to use Github commands and then having them integrate with Netlify.  

To develop the backend CMS I taught myself [Stackbit](https://www.stackbit.com/).
