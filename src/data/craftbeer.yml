    craft_beer_brewery_location: Buxton, Norfolk
    craft_beer_description: >-
      This Vienna lager, based on the amazing recipes of old, combine heaps of
      Vienna malt with a touch of Munich and is finished with noble hops.
      Fermented for 8 weeks at 4c, this is a much slower beer to produce than an
      ale, this shows in the complex character and crisp nature of the beer.


      The finished beer is clean and fresh with a fantastic, smooth, biscuity edge.
