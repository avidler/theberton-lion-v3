  We are currently running our Post-Christmas Pizza Menu.


  From 17th January we will resume offering our traditional Sunday roast dinner with all the trimmings each week for 15.95. The selection varies weekly from Roast Topside of Beef, Shoulder of Lamb (Â£16.95), Chicken Breast and Pork Loin.  An ever changing range of specials such as lamb chops and toad in the hole are available alongside these as well as our light bites.
