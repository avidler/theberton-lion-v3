      ###INN Dependence Day – Saturday 4th July\r

      \r

      \r

      \      After over a quarter of a year of enforced closure we are
      delighted to be reopening for both drinks and food on Saturday 4th July.
      We will be open ALL DAY to celebrate. We have been busying ourselves
      getting ready and having assessed the risks, feel we are able to open
      safely for our customers and staff. Our full Risk Assessment will shortly
      be available at www.thebertonlion.co.uk.\r

      \r

      \r

      \      We are **strongly advising table bookings** for indoors and
      outdoors whether you are eating or just coming in for a drink. This will
      help us no end. Whilst we will be open for walk-ins, bookings will take
      priority and you may be asked to wait until we are able to allocate a
      space.\r

      \r

      \r

      \      Our capacity inside has been reduced to ensure 1m+ distancing
      is observed and whilst we have extended our garden area, due to the
      Government restrictions on the number of households socialising as
      detailed in our risk assessment as well as a curfew of 9.30pm in the
      extended section, we anticipate that at times we will reach table capacity
      and be unable to accommodate unexpected arrivals.\r

      \r

      \r

      \      As part of our review we are changing our trading hours. We
      are closing an hour earlier Tuesday – Thursday and closing all day on
      Mondays but have taken the step to extend Saturdays to ALL DAY for drinks
      and food as an experiment. These times are subject to change;\r

      \"Temporary Opening Times\")\r

      \r

      \r

      \      Due to restrictions at present, many of our regular events
      including live music, Rock and Roll Bingo and Open Mic Night are on hold
      but we are working on plans to reinstate **Beer Club** and **Book Club**
      and will be launching a monthly **Big Saturday Quiz Night** in the coming
      weeks. We will shortly be announcing our themed food nights for the next
      few months and our **5th Annual Beer Festival** will happen, just a little
      later in October! \r

      \r

      \r

      \      From Saturday our **New Menu** will be available to eat in
      but rest assured we will now permanently offer our popular **Takeaway
      Menu**. As currently, takeaway orders need \r

      \r

      \      to be booked in advance with collection slots allocated. We
      will then deliver to you in the car park. \r

      \r

      \r

      \      **Five real ales** will be available on July 4th as well as
      Calvors Helles Lager, Briarbank Black Horse Stout, our extensive range of
      unique wines, boutique spirits and an extensive soft drink selection. \r

      \r

      \r

      \      **When arriving at The Theberton Lion you will notice some
      changes.** \r

      \r

      \r

      \      As recommended by the Government, a **one-way system** will
      be in operation with customers **entering by the front door** and
      **leaving by the back** and then **departing via the garden gate**. If
      re-entering, this is via the front door. \r

      \r

      \r

      \      **All drinkers inside will need to be based at tables and
      table service will operate for these customers.** There will sadly be no
      bar stools and no drinking at the bar at present. \r

      \r

      \r

      \      **Bar service is available to those drinking outside only**
      but customers must enter via the front door. **Vaping is no longer
      permitted indoors.** \r

      \r

      \r

      \      It goes without saying but please do not visit if you have
      any COVID symptoms, such as a new continuous cough, fever or a loss of
      taste/smell. Similarly we ask that you wash your hands and use the
      sanitisers provided regularly to keep yourselves safe. **Children must be
      seated at tables whether inside or out.** Dogs are still welcome but must
      be kept on leads at all times. \r

      \r

      \r

      \      Upon booking/arrival we will ask you to confirm how many
      households make up your party and will be following the latest Government
      advice regarding groups and social distancing. \r

      \r

      \r

      \      We still accept cash but prefer contactless payment where
      possible. Change will be given from a ‘clean float’. \r

      \r

      \r

      \      Signage will be displayed throughout the premises to
      reinforce this and other guidance. Please follow this advice and just ask
      if anything is unclear. \r

      \r

      \r

      \      Whilst the Government’s stance on Covid 19 is being relaxed,
      there are still guidelines and legislation to keep us all safe. We have
      spent a considerable amount of time assessing and mitigating risks. The
      last thing anyone wants is a second wave of this horrid virus. With this
      in mind if customers are not willing to abide by our policies we will
      refuse service. We don’t think this will be a problem but we do have a
      duty of care to protect our customers and staff. \r

      \r

      \r

      \      Finally we want to say a massive thank you for your support
      during this challenging time, you have been amazing. It’s so fantastic to
      be back. We will get through this together so come and laugh, socialise
      responsibly, eat, drink and be merry safely. \r

      \r

      \r

      \      We’ll see you very soon, \r

      \r

      \r

      \      Tom, Helen and the Whole Lion Team\r
